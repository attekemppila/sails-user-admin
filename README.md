# sails-user-admin

A simple user management framework for [Sails](http://sailsjs.org). Install with `npm install` and run with `sails lift`. Then navigate to http://127.0.0.1/register and log in through http://127.0.0.1/login to get access to all features. The first user to register into the system becomes the superuser.

Users can be administered through the control panel at http://127.0.0.1/manage when logged in as a superuser. New users are listed on the first page, and their access can be allowed or denied. These settings can be changed for already processed users through the "Approved users" and "Blocked users" tabs.
